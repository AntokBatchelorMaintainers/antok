Installation instructions for antok
-----------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

* ROOT

  ROOT is available from http://root.cern.ch

* CMake

  CMake is available from http://cmake.org

  In case your distribution does not include a recent version of CMake, you can
  compile it yourself:

  1. Download CMake from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
  2. Prepare installation
     > bootstrap --prefix=<install directory> [--parallel=<# of jobs>] \
                 [--qt-gui]
  3. Compile
     > make && make install
  4. Add <install directory>/bin to your path or use an alias for cmake.

* Boost

  While antok itself does not use the Boost libraries, the YAML prerequisite
  (see below) needs it. Boost is available at http://www.boost.org. As Boost is
  a header only library, nothing has to be compiled.

* YAML

  The configuration files for antok are written in the YAML format. The library
  yaml-cpp reads parses these files. It is available from
  http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/
  It is recommended to use the Mercurial checkout like so

  1. > mkdir <install directory>
  2. > cd <install directory>
  3. > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/ .
  4. > mkdir build
  5. > cd build
  6. > cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
  7. > make [-j <# of jobs>]

Building antok
--------------

1. Make sure you have all prerequisites.

2. Make sure the ROOT environmental variables are set up correctly.

3. Make sure $BOOST_ROOT points to the Boost top level directory.

4. Make sure $YAML_CPP points to the yaml-cpp top level directory (not the
   build directory!).

5. Go to the build directory in the antok directory.

6. Execute
     > cmake .. && make [-j <# of jobs>]

7. Enjoy
